# What is Fake Store?
---

**Fake Store** is a project built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator, and also using FakeStoreAPI. FakeStoreAPI is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need pseudo-real data for your e-commerce or shopping website without running any server-side code.

# Fake Store Repository

This repository is built in GitHub, wich is a platform of `font-code hosting`, and Git, wich is a `Version Control System`. It contains a main folder, wich is "my-website" and contains three  wich are "Docs", "Source", and "Static".

# Starting the local development server
---

### Installation

For the developer to start the development server, he has to type the following commands into the terminal:

```js
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```
You can run this command anywhere in a new empty repository or within an existing repository, it will create a new directory containing the scaffolded files.

### Local Development

```js
npm run start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Docs

This is a folder wich contains information about Cart, Login, Products and User information. 

All of these information inside **docs** appear for the user on the `docs` page of the website, with branches of each one of these main subtitles.

### Source

This is a folder wich contains components of what happens in the "background" of the website.

<p class = "p_example">Example</p>

The `custom.css` file is inside the **Source** folder. This is a file wich controls the styling aspects of the `main` page, the `docs` page and pretty much all of the style of the website. The font-code of this file doesn't appear for the user while he's using the website, but it can be found in the repository on GitHub.

### Static

This is a folder wich contains basically the images and logo files used on the website. Its information can also be found in the GitHub repository.
